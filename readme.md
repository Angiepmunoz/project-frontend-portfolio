### External APIs

Your instructors will give you access to a Pursuit-hosted API that contains a variety of data. You can build your application using any one of these data sets if you so choose.

In addition to the Pursuit-hosted API, you may wish to choose from some of the following APIs. These APIs may require API keys. Before committing to working with one of the following APIs, _ensure that you can get access to the data from it via a request from a front-end application._ It _is not recommended_ that you pay for an API for this project.

1. [Star Wars](https://swapi.dev/)
1. [Weather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
1. [News](https://newsapi.org/)
1. [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/)
1. [Pokemon](http://pokeapi.co/)
1. [Card Deck](https://deckofcardsapi.com/)
1. [Google Books](https://developers.google.com/books/)
1. [City of Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)
1. [Chuck Norris](http://www.icndb.com/)
1. [Rick and Morty](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest)

The following two websites provide access to a number of APIs. Not all of these APIs are easy to access and some will be paid. Please be careful before engaging with an unknown API.

1. [GitHub: Public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
1. [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/)

### Additional features or tasks

Each Fellow must also define _one or more_ additional features or tasks they would like to add to their application. These features or tasks must be approved by an instructor and should make a meaningful improvement to your application. Below is a list of example features that could apply to any application. You may choose from the list below or come up with features or tasks that are more relevant to your specific application.

> **Note:** These features _do count_ for the rubric category "technical innovation", detailed above.

- Add a button or icon to the error that displays when a form is incorrectly filled out. When this button or icon is clicked, the error is removed from the page.
- Use [CSS transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions) to add effects to your page.
- Incorporate fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) onto your page to improve the styling.
- Store some information locally through [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). This information should affect what is shown on the page when the page is reloaded.
- Use a CSS framework such as [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) or [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
- Split your CSS or JavaScript into multiple files, with each file relating to a specific functionality. For example, create a new file called `api.js` that includes the JavaScript code that makes requests to your external API.

## Getting started

_Do not_ fork this repository. Instead, create your repository on GitHub and submit the URL directly to Canvas.

Then, follow the specifications above to create your application. Work with your instructors to approve your features before you begin working on them.
